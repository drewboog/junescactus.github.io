  <strong>Note on International Vendors</strong><br>
  Many cactus/succulent plant and seed vendors exist abroad. Itâ€™s common to see plants from China, Ukraine, Spain, etc on eBay for cheap prices. A phytosanitary certificate, CITES certificate and USDA plant import permit is required to clear US customs. Without these permits the plants will be confiscated and destroyed, and you will receive the empty box. Thus, this list includes only US vendors.
